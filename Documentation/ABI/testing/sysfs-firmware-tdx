Description:
                Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) protect guest VMs from
                malicious hosts and some physical attacks.  This directory
                represents the entry point directory for the TDX.

                the TDX requires the TDX firmware to load into an isolated
                memory region.  It requires a two-step loading process.  It uses
                the first phase firmware loader (a.k.a NP-SEAMLDR) that loads
                the next loader and the second phase firmware loader(a.k.a
                P-SEAMLDR) that loads the TDX firmware(a.k.a the "TDX module").

Description:
                The TDX requires a firmware as known as the TDX module.  It comes
                with its attributes, vendor_id, build_data, build_num,
                minor_version, major_version, etc.

                Provides the information about the TDX module loaded on the
                platform.  It contains the following read-only files.  The
                information corresponds to the data structure, TDSYSINFO_STRUCT.
                The admins or VMM management software like libvirt can refer to
                that information, determine if TDX is supported, and identify
                the loaded the TDX module.

                ================== ============================================
                status             string of the TDX module status.
                                   "unknown"
                                   "none": the TDX module is not loaded
                                   "loaded": The TDX module is loaded, but not
                                             initialized
                                   "initialized": the TDX module is fully
                                                  initialized
                                   "shutdown": the TDX module is shutdown due to
                                               error during initialization.
                attributes         32bit flags of the TDX module attributes as
                                   a hexadecimal number with the "0x" prefix.
                                   Bits 31 - a production module(0) or

                                   Bits 30:0 Reserved - set to 0.
                vendor_id          vendor ID as a hexadecimal number with the
                                   "0x" prefix.
                build_date         build date in yyyymmdd BCD format.
                build_num          build number as a hexadecimal number with
                                   the "0x" prefix.
                minor_version      minor version as a hexadecimal number with
                                   the "0x" prefix.
