Date:		September, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(WO) Up to 64 bytes of user specified binary data. For replay
		protection this should include a nonce, but the kernel does not
		place any restrictions on the content.

What:		/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report/$name/outblob
Date:		September, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) Binary attestation report generated from @inblob and other
		options The format of the report is implementation specific
		where the implementation is conveyed via the @provider
		attribute.

Date:		October, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) Optional supplemental data that a TSM may emit, visibility
		of this attribute depends on TSM, and may be empty if no
		auxiliary data is available.

		When @provider is "sev_guest" this file contains the
		"cert_table" from SEV-ES Guest-Hypervisor Communication Block

Description:
		(RO) A name for the format-specification of @outblob like
		"sev_guest" [1] or "tdx_guest" [2] in the near term, or a
		common standard format in the future.

Date:		September, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) The value in this attribute increments each time @inblob or
		any option is written. Userspace can detect conflicts by
		checking generation before writing to any attribute and making
		sure the number of writes matches expectations after reading
		@outblob, or it can prevent conflicts by creating a report
		instance per requesting context.

Date:		September, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(WO) Attribute is visible if a TSM implementation provider
		supports the concept of attestation reports for TVMs running at
		different privilege levels, like SEV-SNP "VMPL", specify the
		privilege level via this attribute.  The minimum acceptable
		value is conveyed via @privlevel_floor and the maximum
		acceptable value is TSM_PRIVLEVEL_MAX (3).

Date:		September, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) Indicates the minimum permissible value that can be written
		to @privlevel.

Date:		January, 2024
KernelVersion:	v6.8
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RW) The value in this attribute is the Runtime Measurement
		Register (RTMR) digest. Callers can extend this digest with
		additional hashes by writing into it. Binary blobs written to
		this attribute must be of the exact length used by the hash
		algorithm for this RTMR.

Date:		January, 2024
KernelVersion:	v6.8
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RW) A Runtime Measurement Register (RTMR) hardware index.
                Once created under /sys/kernel/config/tsm/rtmrs/, an RTMR entry
                can be mapped to a hardware RTMR by writing into its index
                attribute. The TSM provider will then map the configfs entry to
                its corresponding hardware register.

Date:		January, 2024
KernelVersion:	v6.8
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) A representation of the architecturally defined mapping
		between this RTMR and one or more TCG TPM PCRs [1]. When using
		a TSM as Root of Trust for Storage (RTS), TCG TPM PCRs
		associated semantics and indexes can be used when RTMRs are
		logically mapped to TPM PCRs.
