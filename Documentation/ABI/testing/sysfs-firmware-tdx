Description:
                Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) protect guest VMs from
                malicious hosts and some physical attacks.  This directory
                represents the entry point directory for the TDX.

                This feature requires the TDX firmware to load into an isolated
                memory region.  It uses two-step loading process; the first
                phase is NP-SEAMLDR loader that loads the next one and the
                second phase is P-SEAMLDR loader that loads the TDX firmware
                (a.k.a the "TDX module").

                =============== ================================================
                keyid_num       the number of SEAM keyid as an hexadecimal
                                number with the "0x" prefix.

Description:
                The TDX feature requires a firmware that is known as the TDX
                module. The module exposes its information in the following
                read-only files. The information corresponds to the data
                structure named TDSYSINFO_STRUCT. Administrators or VMM
                managers like libvirt can refer to it to determine if TDX is
                supported and identify the loaded module.

                ================== ============================================
                status             string of the TDX module status.

                                   * "unknown", "none": the TDX module is not
                                     loaded
                                   * "loaded": The TDX module is loaded, but
                                     not initialized
                                   * "initialized": the TDX module is fully
                                     initialized
                                   * "shutdown": the TDX module is shutdown due
                                     to error during initialization.

                attributes         32-bit flags of the TDX module attributes as
                                   a hexadecimal number with the "0x" prefix.

                                   * Bits 31 - a production module(0) or
                                     a debug module(1).
                                   * Bits 0-30 - Reserved - set to 0.

                vendor_id          vendor ID as a hexadecimal number with the
                                   "0x" prefix.
                build_date         build date in yyyymmdd BCD format.
                build_num          build number as a hexadecimal number with
                                   the "0x" prefix.
                minor_version      minor version as a hexadecimal number with
                                   the "0x" prefix.
                major_version      major version as a hexadecimal number with
                                   the "0x" prefix.
