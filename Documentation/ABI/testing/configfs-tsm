Date:		August, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(WO) Up to 64 bytes of user specified binary data. For replay
		protection this should include a nonce, but the kernel does not
		place any restrictions on the content.

Date:		August, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) Binary attestation report generated from @inblob and other
		options The format of the report is implementation specific
		(modulo options like @format and @privlevel) where the
		implementation is conveyed via the @provider attribute.

What:		/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report/$name/provider
Date:		August, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) A name for the format-specification of @outblob like
		"sev-snp" or "tdx" in the near term, or a common standard format
		in the future.

Date:		August, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) The value in this attribute increments each time @inblob or
		any option is written. Userspace can detect conflicts by
		checking generation before writing to any attribute and making
		sure the number of writes matches expectations after reading
		@outblob, or it can prevent conflicts by creating a report
		instance per requesting context.

What:		/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report/$name/privlevel
Date:		August, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(WO) If a TSM implementation supports the concept of attestation
		reports for TVMs running at different privilege levels, like
		SEV-SNP "VMPL", specify the privilege level via this attribute.
		The minimum acceptable value is conveyed via @privlevel_floor
		and the maximum acceptable value is TSM_PRIVLEVEL_MAX (3).

What:		/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report/$name/privlevel_floor

Description:
		(RO) Indicates the minimum permissible value that can be written

What:		/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report/$name/format
Date:		August, 2023
KernelVersion:	v6.7
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(WO) If a TSM implementation supports the concept of attestation
		reports with "extended" contents, like SEV-SNP extended reports
		with certificate chains, specify "extended" vs "default" via
		this attribute.
