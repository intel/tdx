Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)
===================================

Overview
========
TDX stands for Trust Domain Extensions which isolates VMs from
the virtual-machine manager (VMM)/hypervisor and any other software on
the platform. For details, see the specifications [1]_, whitepaper [2]_,
architectural extensions specification [3]_, module documentation [4]_,
loader interface specification [5]_, guest-hypervisor communication
interface [6]_, virtual firmware design guide [7]_, and other resources
([8]_, [9]_, [10]_, [11]_, and [12]_).

===============

KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP
---------------------
:Type: vm ioctl, vcpu ioctl

For TDX operations, KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP is re-purposed to be generic
ioctl with TDX specific sub ioctl command.

::

  /* Trust Domain eXtension sub-ioctl() commands. */
  enum kvm_tdx_cmd_id {
          KVM_TDX_CAPABILITIES = 0,

- data: must be 0
- error: must be 0
- unused: must be 0

KVM TDX creation flow
=====================
In addition to KVM normal flow, new TDX ioctls need to be called.  The control flow
looks like as follows.

#. system wide capability check

   * KVM_CAP_VM_TYPES: check if VM type is supported and if TDX_VM_TYPE is
     supported.

#. creating VM

   * KVM_CREATE_VM
   * KVM_TDX_CAPABILITIES: query if TDX is supported on the platform.
   * KVM_TDX_INIT_VM: pass TDX specific VM parameters.

#. creating VCPU

   * KVM_CREATE_VCPU
   * KVM_TDX_INIT_VCPU: pass TDX specific VCPU parameters.

#. initializing guest memory

   * allocate guest memory and initialize page same to normal KVM case
     In TDX case, parse and load TDVF into guest memory in addition.
   * KVM_TDX_INIT_MEM_REGION to add and measure guest pages.
     If the pages has contents above, those pages need to be added.
     Otherwise the contents will be lost and guest sees zero pages.
   * KVM_TDX_FINALIAZE_VM: Finalize VM and measurement
     This must be after KVM_TDX_INIT_MEM_REGION.

#. run vcpu

Design discussion
=================

Coexistence of normal(VMX) VM and TD VM
---------------------------------------
It's required to allow both legacy(normal VMX) VMs and new TD VMs to
coexist. Otherwise the benefits of VM flexibility would be eliminated.
The main issue for it is that the logic of kvm_x86_ops callbacks for
TDX is different from VMX. On the other hand, the variable,
kvm_x86_ops, is global single variable. Not per-VM, not per-vcpu.

Several points to be considered:

  * No or minimal overhead when TDX is disabled(CONFIG_INTEL_TDX_HOST=n).
  * Avoid overhead of indirect call via function pointers.
  * Contain the changes under arch/x86/kvm/vmx directory and share logic
    with VMX for maintenance.
    Even though the ways to operation on VM (VMX instruction vs TDX
    SEAM call) are different, the basic idea remains the same. So, many
    logic can be shared.
  * Future maintenance
    The huge change of kvm_x86_ops in (near) future isn't expected.
    a centralized file is acceptable.

- Wrapping kvm x86_ops: The current choice

  Introduce dedicated file for arch/x86/kvm/vmx/main.c (the name,
  main.c, is just chosen to show main entry points for callbacks.) and
  wrapper functions around all the callbacks with
  "if (is-tdx) tdx-callback() else vmx-callback()".

  Pros:

  - No major change in common x86 KVM code. The change is (mostly)
    contained under arch/x86/kvm/vmx/.
  - When TDX is disabled(CONFIG_INTEL_TDX_HOST=n), the overhead is
    optimized out.
  - Micro optimization by avoiding function pointer.

  Cons:

  - Many boiler plates in arch/x86/kvm/vmx/main.c.

KVM MMU Changes
---------------
KVM MMU needs to be enhanced to handle Secure/Shared-EPT. The
high-level execution flow is mostly same to normal EPT case.
EPT violation/misconfiguration -> invoke TDP fault handler ->
resolve TDP fault -> resume execution. (or emulate MMIO)
The difference is, that S-EPT is operated(read/write) via TDX SEAM
call which is expensive instead of direct read/write EPT entry.
One bit of GPA (51 or 47 bit) is repurposed so that it means shared
with host(if set to 1) or private to TD(if cleared to 0).

- The current implementation

  * Reuse the existing MMU code with minimal update.  Because the
    execution flow is mostly same. But additional operation, TDX call
    for S-EPT, is needed. So add hooks for it to kvm_x86_ops.
  * For performance, minimize TDX SEAM call to operate on S-EPT. When
    getting corresponding S-EPT pages/entry from faulting GPA, don't
    use TDX SEAM call to read S-EPT entry. Instead create shadow copy
    in host memory.
    Repurpose the existing kvm_mmu_page as shadow copy of S-EPT and
    associate S-EPT to it.
  * Treats share bit as attributes. mask/unmask the bit where
    necessary to keep the existing traversing code works.
    Introduce kvm.arch.gfn_shared_mask and use "if (gfn_share_mask)"
    for special case.

    * 0 : for non-TDX case
    * 51 or 47 bit set for TDX case.

  Pros:

  - Large code reuse with minimal new hooks.
  - Execution path is same.

  Cons:

  - Complicates the existing code.
  - Repurpose kvm_mmu_page as shadow of Secure-EPT can be confusing.

New KVM API, ioctl (sub)command, to manage TD VMs
-------------------------------------------------
Additional KVM APIs are needed to control TD VMs. The operations on TD
VMs are specific to TDX.

- Piggyback and repurpose KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP

  Although operations for TD VMs aren't necessarily related to memory
  encryption, define sub operations of KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP for TDX specific
  ioctls.

  Pros:

  - No major change in common x86 KVM code.
  - Follows the SEV case.

  Cons:

  - The sub operations of KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP aren't necessarily memory
    encryption, but operations on TD VMs.
