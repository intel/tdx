Description:
		Used to update and check the authorization status of the given
		device. Only authorized device is allowed to bind the driver.
		If authorization status is updated, it will attempt to bind or
		unbind the driver based on the authorization status. This is only
		enabled for bus devices which are marked authorizable. Acceptable
		values are,

		===========  ===================================================
		"on" or 1    device is authorized and allowed to bind the driver.
		"off" or 0   device is not authorized and cannot bind driver.

		Currently this is supported on all devices expect for bus or
		subsystem devices which opt out of it by marking it non
		authorizable.
